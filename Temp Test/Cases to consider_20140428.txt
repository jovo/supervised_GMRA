1. Case where all the data points in a node has only one unique label
2. Case where there is no active nodes from the training stage.
   Need to debug the GMRA_Classifier.m, all the children errors being Inf.
   (2)Deleted the variable 'track_activenode' I have created, since it should be zero anyways.

Chages to keep
(1) Input option of 'classifier' for GMRA_Classifier_test.m
    fcn_single_node_test Input Struct
(2) Do I need to keep this for the GMRA_Classifier_Test.m to run
       in case ther is no active nodes?
